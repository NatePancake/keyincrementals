# keyincrementals
random python thing i'm making, trying to make gameplay as long as possible because it's an incremental game :3
might as well just type the upgrade path here

(note that you only progress every tick)
(obviously the upgrades would only work each tick)

regular key
milestone 1 - 3 (activating 1 gives you +0.001 base key gain per tick)
optional 1 - +0.005 base key gain per tick
optional 2 - +2 key multiplier
optional 3 - +0.01 base key gain per tick
optional 4 - +5 key multiplier
optional 5 - +0.05 base key gain per tick

monster key - +^1.01 base key gain per tick
milestone 4 - 6
